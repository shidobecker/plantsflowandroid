/**
 * A flow is an asynchronous version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced. Just like a sequence, a
 * flow produces each value on-demand whenever the value is needed, and flows can contain an infinite number of values.

So, why did Kotlin introduce a new Flow type, and how is it different than a regular sequence? The answer lies in the magic of async. Flow includes
full support for coroutines. That means you can build, transform, and consume aFlow using coroutines.
You can also control concurrency, which means coordinating the execution of several coroutines declaratively with Flow.

    /**
     * This defines a new ConflatedBroadcastChannel. This is a special kind of coroutine-based value holder that holds only the last value
     * it was given. It's a thread-safe concurrency primitive, so you can write to it from multiple threads at the same time
     * (and whichever is considered "last" will win).

    You can also subscribe to get updates to the current value. Overall, it has the similar behavior to a LiveDataâ€“it just holds the last
    value and lets you observe changes to it. However, unlike LiveData, you have to use coroutines to read values on multiple threads.

    A ConflatedBroadcastChannel is often a good way to insert events into a flow. It provides a concurrency primitive (or low-level tool)
    for passing values between several coroutines.

    By conflating the events, we keep track of only the most recent event. This is often the correct thing to do, since UI events may come in
    faster than processing, and we usually don't care about intermediate values.

    If you do need to pass all events between coroutines and don't want conflation, consider using a Channel which offers the semantics of a
    BlockingQueue using suspend functions. The channelFlow builder can be used to make channel backed flows.

    Also in the ViewModel, add a cache update to the init block. This step is optional for now,
    but if you clear your cache and don't add this call, you will not see any data in the app.
